PRISM enables end-users to interact with the model they are interested in, without worrying about having the required hardware resources, or setting up complex code on their computer. In its current implementation, PRISM can host models created in R, and can be accessed through Microsoft Excel and R. PRISM Introduction. PRISM on GitHub. "],
["section-api.html", "2 Application Programming Interface (API) What is an API? REST", " 2 Application Programming Interface (API) This section is geared towards people who are less familiar with APIs, or who want a refresher. If you are comfortable with APIs and don’t need a review, you can skip to the next section. What is an API? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client You are the Client Suppose you are at home, on your laptop, and you want to use a cool new piece of software that you found on the internet. Let's say the software is written in the R language. What if you don't have R on your computer? You could install R, but maybe you don't want to. Or what if you actually want to use the software in a different language, like Python? Or maybe you want to use it in several different languages? This is what an API is for. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Server PRISM is on the Server Server is a word used a lot in programming, and all it means is computer. In this context, the server is the computer you will be connecting to; it is the computer with the software that you want to use. API communicates We can use the API to communicate between the Client and the Server. In the example above, you could use the API to use an R software package that lives on a computer (Server) somewhere else, without having to download or use R on your computer. REST REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Ah yes, clear as mud. I understand the words individually, but… REST is basically the rules for how the client (your computer) can talk to the server (the computer with PRISM, say). It is the rules for the API. REST is a simple language. It isn’t like English, or French, or Mandarin. It only has 4 words! So much easier to be bilingual… The 4 words are: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Simple, right? It turns out, the difficulty comes in defining the words. The official definitions are fairly broad and rather vague, when in practice the use of the words depend on: a) context and b) general rules of thumb. A bit like English after all! GET When using an API, you have 2 options: you may send some data, and receive something back, or you can just receive something back. GET is the function where you just receive data. For this tutorial, we are going to use the Google Books API, which I chose because it has good documentation and doesn’t require you to get an API key. Google Books is a huge database of books. The database lives on a computer somewhere else, called the Server. You, at home on your computer (Client), would like to see if you can find a book using Google’s software. Specifically, you want to find the book “Introduction to Quantum Mechanics” by David J. Griffiths. How will you find it? You will use a GET request. First, you need to know how to write the query. Here are a couple of rules: space = “+” use “?q=” to start the query use “intitle:” to search for a word in the title use “inauthor:” to search for a word in the author name separate everything else with “+” Okay, let’s get started: “?q=” to start the query “intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics” to search for our title “inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths” to search for our author Putting them all together: “?q=intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics+inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths” Now that we have made our query, we are ready to make our GET request. Below is the code you will need to do this. In the top right corner, you can select the language which you prefer to use. curl -X GET https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics+inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths request = new XMLHttpRequest(); request.open('GET', 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics+inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths'); request.send(); library(httr) library(jsonlite) response = GET(url='https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics+inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths') import json import requests response = requests.get('https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics+inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths') If you are doing the Bash option, the results should print out automatically. For the other languages, we can print the response: console.log(request.status()); console.log(request.response()); print(response$status) rawUnicode = response$content text = rawToChar(rawUnicode) results = fromJSON(text) print(results) print(response.status_code) text = response.text results = json.loads(text) print(results) In printing the results, the status code should be “200,” and the printed text should be something like this: { &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;books#volumes&quot;, &quot;totalItems&quot;: 1, &quot;items&quot;: [ { &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;books#volume&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;0h-nDAAAQBAJ&quot;, &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;OTURZeInoRk&quot;, &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0h-nDAAAQBAJ&quot;, &quot;volumeInfo&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Introduction to Quantum Mechanics&quot;, &quot;authors&quot;: [ &quot;David Griffiths&quot; ], &quot;publisher&quot;: &quot;Cambridge University Press&quot;, &quot;publishedDate&quot;: &quot;2016-08-31&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This best-selling textbook teaches students how to do quantum mechanics and provides an insightful discussion of what it actually means.&quot;, &quot;industryIdentifiers&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ISBN_13&quot;, &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;9781107179868&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ISBN_10&quot;, &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;1107179866&quot; } ], &quot;readingModes&quot;: { &quot;text&quot;: false, &quot;image&quot;: true }, &quot;pageCount&quot;: 465, &quot;printType&quot;: &quot;BOOK&quot;, &quot;categories&quot;: [ &quot;Science&quot; ], &quot;averageRating&quot;: 4.0, &quot;ratingsCount&quot;: 4, &quot;maturityRating&quot;: &quot;NOT_MATURE&quot;, &quot;allowAnonLogging&quot;: false, &quot;contentVersion&quot;: &quot;preview-1.0.0&quot;, &quot;panelizationSummary&quot;: { &quot;containsEpubBubbles&quot;: false, &quot;containsImageBubbles&quot;: false }, &quot;imageLinks&quot;: { &quot;smallThumbnail&quot;: &quot;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0h-nDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=5&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api&quot;, &quot;thumbnail&quot;: &quot;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0h-nDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api&quot; }, &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;, &quot;previewLink&quot;: &quot;http://books.google.ca/books?id=0h-nDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics+inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths&amp;hl=&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_api&quot;, &quot;infoLink&quot;: &quot;http://books.google.ca/books?id=0h-nDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Introduction+intitle:to+intitle:Quantum+intitle:Mechanics+inauthor:David+inauthor:Griffiths&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api&quot;, &quot;canonicalVolumeLink&quot;: &quot;https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Quantum_Mechanics.html?hl=&amp;id=0h-nDAAAQBAJ&quot; }, &quot;saleInfo&quot;: { &quot;country&quot;: &quot;CA&quot;, &quot;saleability&quot;: &quot;NOT_FOR_SALE&quot;, &quot;isEbook&quot;: false }, &quot;accessInfo&quot;: { &quot;country&quot;: &quot;CA&quot;, &quot;viewability&quot;: &quot;PARTIAL&quot;, &quot;embeddable&quot;: true, &quot;publicDomain&quot;: false, &quot;textToSpeechPermission&quot;: &quot;ALLOWED&quot;, &quot;epub&quot;: { &quot;isAvailable&quot;: false }, &quot;pdf&quot;: { &quot;isAvailable&quot;: false }, &quot;webReaderLink&quot;: &quot;http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0h-nDAAAQBAJ&amp;hl=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_api&quot;, &quot;accessViewStatus&quot;: &quot;SAMPLE&quot;, &quot;quoteSharingAllowed&quot;: false }, &quot;searchInfo&quot;: { &quot;textSnippet&quot;: &quot;This bestselling textbook teaches students how to do quantum mechanics and provides an insightful discussion of what it actually means.&quot; } } ] } Congrats! You have completed your first GET request! POST The POST call is a bit more complicated than the GET call. The primary difference is that for a POST call, you send data AND receive data. You probably have made a post on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram; those are examples of POST calls. Say you want to tweet “hello” on Twitter. You would send this data with a POST call to the Twitter API. The Twitter API would then add your new post, and will return a JSON object that looks something like this: { &quot;created_at&quot;: &quot;Wed Oct 10 20:19:24 +0000 2018&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1050118621198921700, &quot;id_str&quot;: &quot;1050118621198921728&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;To make room for more expression, we will now count all emojis as equal—including those with gender and skin t… https://t.co/MkGjXf9aXm&quot;, &quot;source&quot;: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter Web Client&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, &quot;truncated&quot;: true, &quot;in_reply_to_status_id&quot;: null, &quot;in_reply_to_status_id_str&quot;: null, &quot;in_reply_to_user_id&quot;: null, &quot;in_reply_to_user_id_str&quot;: null, &quot;in_reply_to_screen_name&quot;: null, &quot;user&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: 6253282, &quot;id_str&quot;: &quot;6253282&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Twitter API&quot;, &quot;screen_name&quot;: &quot;TwitterAPI&quot;, &quot;location&quot;: &quot;San Francisco, CA&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://developer.twitter.com&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The Real Twitter API.

Basically, if you want to POST a tweet, Twitter needs to know that it is you asking to post on your account, and not someone else. However, getting an authentication token can take a bit of time, as you have to set up a developer account etc. In data science, sometimes a POST request looks a bit different than the Twitter POST request. For example, let’s say there is a machine learning algorithm which is able to tell you if a picture is a Cat or a Dog. This algorithm is on a Server somewhere else, and you want to use the API to check if your photo is a Cat or a Dog. This would also be an example of a POST request. You would send the data, which would be the picture, using a POST call. The API would communicate with the Server, and the algorithm would calculate if the picture was a Cat or a Dog. Then the algorithm would send back data, say a JSON file with the text “image: Cat”. Now you know that your image is a Cat! PUT The PUT request is similar to POST in that you can send and receive data. However, the PUT request is used less often. The reason for this is what computer scientists and mathematicians call “idempotency.” An action is idempotent if repeating the action results in the same end result. Still kind of complicated, right? Let’s do an example. The POST request is not idempotent. If you make a post on Twitter today, saying, “I love tacos!”, and then later on you make another post that says “I love tacos!”, both of those posts will stay on Twitter. The second post won’t erase the first post [even though people already know you love tacos]. You can post “I love tacos!” as many times as you want, and Twitter will just keep adding it to your status. On the other hand, the PUT request is idempotent. PUT is less often used because it means finding and overriding a specific resource. For example, say you have an online library, where a book is a resource. You would probably want to have a GET request, so people could get a book and read it. You might have a POST request, where people could add a new book to the library. A PUT request would be finding a book and replacing it with a newer version. So maybe you want to find the textbook “Introduction to Quantum Mechanics 2,” and replace it with the latest version, “Introduction to Quantum Mechanics 3.” You could use a PUT request for this. As you may have figured out, the PUT request can potentially delete items. Probably, you don’t want just any person being able to replace books in the library. So, you might have a few “librarians” who are able to make PUT requests. DELETE DELETE is the last REST call, and it is fairly self-explanatory. In keeping with the online library, this would be deleting a book altogether. Similar to the PUT request, this generally is a call that only certain users have access to. Another example of the DELETE request would be in Facebook. Maybe you made a post 5 years ago that was fairly embarassing. Maybe it was “I love tacos!” You could use a DELETE request to delete this post. Summary In REST jargon, we call data on the Server a resource. So in Google Books, the resource is a book. On Twitter, a resource might be a tweet. I wanted to point out here that a Server can have more than one resource, and can therefore have more than one GET/POST/PUT/DELETE calls. On the flip side, an API does not need to have all four calls. As you will see, often the only calls are GET and POST. In our API (PRISM), which you will read more about later, we only have POST calls at the moment. I have taken a table from the Twitter API documentation to give you an example: Tweets Retweets Likes (formerly favorites) POST statuses/update POST statuses/destroy/:id GET statuses/show/:id GET statuses/oembed GET statuses/lookup POST statuses/retweet/:id POST statuses/unretweet/:id GET statuses/retweets/:id GET statuses/retweets_of_me GET statuses/retweeters/ids POST favorites/create/:id POST favorites/destroy/:id GET favorites/list API in R API in Python API in Bash/Shell API in Javascript "],
["section-using-prism.html", "3 Using the PRISM API 3.1 PRISM API in Excel 3.2 PRISM API in R/Python/Bash/Javascript", " 3 Using the PRISM API If you don’t have much programming experience, or if you want to use Excel, I would recommend doing the API in Excel. Otherwise, you can choose your favourite programming language to get started: API in R/Python/Javascript/Bash 3.1 PRISM API in Excel One of the primary goals of PRISM is making prediction models accessible to a wide range of audiences, including those with less programming experience. The Excel API is targetted towards users who are less familiar with programming, or users who are familiar with programming and would like an easy way to extract the data quickly. For this tutorial, I am going to be using the accept model (ACute COPD Exacerbation Prediction Tool). To use the model, you will need to have a spreadsheet program on your computer. Excel is recommended, but Numbers (Mac) will also work. Before getting started, I recommend that you read the ACCEPT Manual, specifically Section 2 (The Study) and Section 3 (Using the Package in R). Downloading the Spreadsheet To get started, you will need to go to: PRISM Model Repository. In the row that has the ACCEPT model, go to the column labelled Excel Interface and click on the link ACCEPT Excel (PC). This will download the Excel Interface for the ACCEPT model. Setting the Inputs Once you have downloaded the Excel Interface, you can open it in Excel. You will notice there are two sheets, labelled Model and Settings. Click on the Model tab. You will notice several tables. The top two tables are input tables, which means that these are values you can change. For each package, we will provide details on what values are allowed. For example, Gender can be either Male or Female. Each package will have a User Guide, and you can find the acceptable inputs under the section Using the Package as an API - Excel API. For this tutorial, go ahead and change Gender from Male to Female. Running the Model To run the model, you need to connect to the model first. Click on the Model sheet. There is a button at the top of the page which says Connect to Model. Click on that button. On the bottom left of the Excel window, you should see the text “Connecting to model…” Click on the Run button. Click on the Disconnect from Model button once it has finished running. 3.2 PRISM API in R/Python/Bash/Javascript To get started, you will need to install a few packages: brew install curl sudo apt install curl install.packages(\"devtools\") devtools::install_github(\"resplab/prism\") pip3 install requests The next step is to get an API key. For now, we will be giving out API keys on a case-by-case basis, so please email either: Amin Adibi: amin.adibi@ubc.ca Mohsen Sadatsafavi: mohsen.sadatsafavi@ubc.ca For the rest of this tutorial, I will be using one of the packages, accept, as the example.
