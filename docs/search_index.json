PRISM enables end-users to interact with the model they are interested in, without worrying about having the required hardware resources, or setting up complex code on their computer. In its current implementation, PRISM can host models created in R, and can be accessed through Microsoft Excel and R. PRISM Introduction. "],

REST Diving in", " 2 Application Programming Interface (API) This section is geared towards people who are less familiar with APIs, or who want a refresher. If you are comfortable with APIs and don’t need a review, you can skip to the next section. What is an API? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client You are the Client Suppose you are at home, on your laptop, and you want to use a cool new piece of software that you found on the internet. Let's say the software is written in the R language. What if you don't have R on your computer? You could install R, but maybe you don't want to. Or what if you actually want to use the software in a different language, like Python? Or maybe you want to use it in several different languages? This is what an API is for. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Server PRISM is on the Server Server is a word used a lot in programming, and all it means is computer. In this context, the server is the computer you will be connecting to; it is the computer with the software that you want to use. API communicates We can use the API to communicate between the Client and the Server. In the example above, you could use the API to use an R software package that lives on a computer (Server) somewhere else, without having to download or use R on your computer. REST REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. Ah yes, clear as mud. I understand the words individually, but… REST is basically the rules for how the client (your computer) can talk to the server (the computer with PRISM, say). It is the rules for the API. REST is a simple language. It isn’t like English, or French, or Mandarin. It only has 4 words! So much easier to be bilingual… The 4 words are: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Simple, right? It turns out, the difficulty comes in defining the words. The official definitions are fairly broad and rather vague, when in practice the use of the words depend on: a) context and b) general rules of thumb. A bit like English after all! GET GET Copy Primary link Diving in I have found it is often easiest to learn by example, so I’m going to walk through an example of how to use our PRISM API. If you don’t have much programming experience, or if you want to use Excel, I would recommend doing the API in Excel. Otherwise, you can choose your favourite programming language to get started: API in R API in Python API in Bash/Shell API in Javascript "],
